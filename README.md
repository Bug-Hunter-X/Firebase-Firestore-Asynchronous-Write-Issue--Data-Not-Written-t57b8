This repository demonstrates an uncommon Firebase Firestore bug where asynchronous operations interfere with data writes, leading to data not being persisted despite successful execution of the write code.  The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation to address the asynchronous issue.  The problem is caused by an asynchronous function completing before the data write operation is fully finished, creating a race condition.
