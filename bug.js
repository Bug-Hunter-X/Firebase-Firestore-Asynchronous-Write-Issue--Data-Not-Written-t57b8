In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't being written to the Firestore database despite seemingly correct code and authentication.  The write operation wouldn't return an error, but the data simply wouldn't appear in the database.  Debugging revealed the problem stemmed from an asynchronous operation completing before the data write was fully executed, resulting in an out-of-sync condition.  The write operation was within a callback function that resolved before the data was committed to Firestore.
